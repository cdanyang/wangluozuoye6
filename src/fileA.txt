Broadcom Linux hybrid wireless driver
Release Version: 6.30.223.141
Release Date: Wed 31 Jul 2013 11:47:12 PM PDT

DISCLAIMER
----------
This is an Official Release of Broadcom's hybrid Linux driver for use with 
Broadcom based hardware.

WHERE TO GET THE RELEASE
------------------------
For General Web releases: http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php

IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCUSSION OF HYBRID DRIVER
----------------------------------------------
There are separate tarballs for 32 bit and 64 bit x86 CPU architectures.
Make sure you use the appropriate tarball for your machine.

Other than 32 vs 64 bit, the hybrid binary is agnostic to the specific
versions (3.5.X) and distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, SuSE, etc).  It performs
all interactions with the OS through OS specific files (wl_linux.c, wl_iw.c,
osl_linux.c) that are shipped in source form. You compile this source on
your system and link with a precompiled binary file (wlc_hybrid.o_shipped)
which contains the rest of the driver.

PRECOMPILED DRIVER
-------------------
Some distros (Ubuntu and Fedora at the least) already have a version of
this driver in their repositories precompiled, tested and ready to go.
You just use the package manager to install the proper package.  If
its available for your distro, this is usually an easier solution. See
the end of this document for further discussion.

ABOUT THIS RELEASE
-------------------
This is a rollup release.  It includes and deprecates all previous releases
and patches.  At the time of release there are no existing patches for this
release from Broadcom.

SUPPORTED DEVICES
-----------------
The cards with the following PCI Device IDs are supported with this driver.

NOTABLE CHANGES
---------------
	Upgraded to support 3.8.x.
	Added 4352 support.
	Dropped WEXT support.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Building this driver requires that your machine have the proper tools,
packages, header files and libraries to build a standard kernel module.
This usually is done by installing the kernel developer or kernel source
package and varies from distro to distro. Consult the documentation for
your specific OS.

If you cannot successfully build a module that comes with your distro's
kernel developer or kernel source package, you will not be able to build
this module either.

If you try to build this module but get an error message that looks like
this:

make: *** /lib/modules/"release"/build: No such file or directory. Stop.

Then you do not have the proper packages installed, since installing the
proper packages will create /lib/modules/"release"/build on your system.

On Fedora install 'kernel-devel' (Development Package for building kernel
modules to match the kernel) from the Package Manager (System->
Administration-> Add/Remove Software).

On Ubuntu, you will need headers and tools.  Try these commands:
# apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic
# apt-get build-dep linux

To check to see if you have this directory do this:

# ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
1. Setup the directory by untarring the proper tarball:

For 32 bit: 	hybrid-v35-nodebug-pcoem-portsrc.tar.gz
For 64 bit: 	hybrid-v35_64-nodebug-pcoem-portsrc.tar.gz

Example:
# mkdir hybrid_wl
# cd hybrid_wl
# tar xzf <path>/hybrid-v35-nodebug-pcoem-portsrc.tar.gz or 
	<path>/hybrid-v35_64-nodebug-pcoem-portsrc.tar.gz

2. Build the driver as a Linux loadable kernel module (LKM):

# make clean   (optional)
# make

When the build completes, it will produce a wl.ko file in the top level
directory.

If your driver does not build, check to make sure you have installed the
kernel package described in the requirements above.

This driver uses cfg80211 API. Code for Wext API is present and can be built
but we have dropped support for it.
As before, the Makefile will still build the matching version for your system.

# make API=CFG80211
 or
# make API=WEXT (deprecated)

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
Upgrading from a previous version:
---------------------------------

If you were already running a previous version of wl, you'll want to provide
a clean transition from the older driver. (The path to previous driver is
usually /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/net/wireless)

# rmmod wl 
# mv <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko.orig
# cp wl.ko <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko
# depmod
# modprobe wl

The new wl driver should now be operational and your all done.

Fresh installation:
------------------
1: Remove any other drivers for the Broadcom wireless device.

There are several other drivers (besides this one) that can drive 
Broadcom 802.11 chips. These include b43, brcmsmac, bcma and ssb. They will
conflict with this driver and need to be uninstalled before this driver
can be installed.  Any previous revisions of the wl driver also need to
be removed.

Note: On some systems such as Ubuntu 9.10, the ssb module may load during
boot even though it is blacklisted (see note under Common Issues on how to
resolve this. Nevertheless, ssb still must be removed
(by hand or script) before wl is loaded. The wl driver will not function 
properly if ssb the module is loaded.

# lsmod  | grep "brcmsmac\|b43\|ssb\|bcma\|wl"

If any of these are installed, remove them:
# rmmod b43
# rmmod brcmsmac
# rmmod ssb
# rmmod bcma
# rmmod wl

To blacklist these drivers and prevent them from loading in the future:
# echo "blacklist ssb" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# echo "blacklist bcma" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# echo "blacklist b43" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# echo "blacklist brcmsmac" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

2: Insmod the driver.

Otherwise, if you have not previously installed a wl driver, you'll need
to add a security module before using the wl module.  Most newer systems 
use lib80211 while others use ieee80211_crypt_tkip. See which one works for 
your system.

# modprobe lib80211 
  or 
# modprobe ieee80211_crypt_tkip

If your using the cfg80211 version of the driver, then cfg80211 needs to be
loaded:

# modprobe cfg80211

Then:

Upgrading from a previous version:
---------------------------------

If you were already running a previous version of wl, you'll want to provide
a clean transition from the older driver. (The path to previous driver is
usually /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/net/wireless)

# rmmod wl 
# mv <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko.orig
# cp wl.ko <path-to-prev-driver>/wl.ko
# depmod
# modprobe wl

The new wl driver should now be operational and your all done.

properly if ssb the module is loaded.

# lsmod  | grep "brcmsmac\|b43\|ssb\|bcma\|wl"

If any of these are installed, remove them:

	
If you want something quick and dirty, try inputStream.available().

if (stream.available() < 2) {
    // throw it
}
If you want true non blocking reads and callbacks when data is available, I think Pablo's answer is better.

I found this by googling "nonblocking sockets", but all I really wanted was to poll the socket for incoming data without blocking the thread. To think it'd be so simple, thanks. –  cib Feb 4 '12 at 15:37

I think Java NIO non-blocking classes are your best choice. Check SocketChannel class and its related code samples.

But be careful, when you issue your read command, it might be the case that bytes are not available yet, but that doesn't mean that the will never arrive to your socket...

If the input ends before supplying two bytes it will throw EOFException. If there is no input available() will return zero, although it can also return zero if there is input in some circumstances (e.g. SSL).

I'm using a DataInputStream to read characters/data from a socket.

I want to use .readUnsignedShort(); and have it throw an exception if there isn't 2 bytes to read. Should I subclass the DataInputStream and override the methods adding the exceptions, or is there an easier way?
